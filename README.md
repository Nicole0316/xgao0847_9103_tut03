## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

In *Arcane*, I was inspired by two main visual techniques. The first is the transition from painterly 3D rendering to a bright, sketch-like hand-drawn style during emotionally intense moments. This contrast helps express inner tension more clearly. The second is the use of fluorescent graffiti lines over charactersâ€”especially Jinxâ€”to show a chaotic or unstable mental state. I aim to recreate these layered and expressive visuals in my own work to reflect changes in mood or character.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To simulate the glowing, unstable energy of Jinxâ€™s graffiti overlays, I plan to use a particle system in p5.js combined with the `blendMode(ADD)` function. This technique allows overlapping particles to become brighter, mimicking a neon effect. By adding randomness to particle movement, opacity, and lifespan, the system can express emotional tension and chaotic motion. The result is a dynamic, layered visual style that reflects instabilityâ€”perfect for translating psychological states into generative art.
