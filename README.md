## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

In *Arcane*, I was inspired by two main visual techniques. The first is the transition from painterly 3D rendering to a bright, sketch-like hand-drawn style during emotionally intense moments. This contrast helps express inner tension more clearly. The second is the use of fluorescent graffiti lines over charactersâ€”especially Jinxâ€”to show a chaotic or unstable mental state. I aim to recreate these layered and expressive visuals in my own work to reflect changes in mood or character.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To express the chaotic energy and layered instability seen in Jinxâ€™s graffiti overlays from Arcane, I chose to use p5.jsâ€™s official smoke particle system. This technique uses drifting particles that fade and disperse, simulating emotional turbulence and dynamic movement. It offers strong visual storytelling potential through generative, expressive motion.

By modifying the particle color to neon hues and adding `blendMode(ADD)`, the system can imitate glowing graffiti strokes. The randomness of particle direction and lifespan further supports the depiction of a fragmented mental state or emotional intensity.
